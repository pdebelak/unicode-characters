# Unicode Characters

A single page app to see and filter unicode characters.

## Development

To regenerate the `unicode.json` file (if, for example, the unicode
database has been updated), run `make json`.

To run a server locally, run `make server`.

All of these commands require a recent version of `node` to be
installed.
